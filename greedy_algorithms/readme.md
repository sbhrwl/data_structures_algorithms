# [Greedy algorithms](lectures/notes/1.IntroductionToGreedyAlgorithms.pdf)
- The greedy method is used for solving **optimization** problems. 
  - An optimization problem is a problem that demands either maximum or minimum results.
- This technique is basically used to determine the feasible solution that may or may not be optimal. 
  - The feasible solution is a subset that satisfies the given criteria. 
  - The optimal solution is the solution which is the best and the most favorable solution in the subset. 
  - In the case of feasible, if more than one solution satisfies the given criteria then those solutions will be considered as the feasible, whereas the **optimal solution is the best solution** among all the solutions

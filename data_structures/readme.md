# Data structures 
- Data structures enables us to store data in a structured manner.
- List, set, map, tree, queue, and stack are common data structures used in computer science and programming. 

## List
- A list is a collection of elements in a specific **order**. 
- Each element is assigned an index, which is used to access it.
- Lists are typically **mutable**, which means that you can modify them by adding, removing, or changing elements.
- Lists are typically used for storing and manipulating data that needs to be **accessed and modified frequently**

## Set 
- A set is a collection of **unique elements** with **no specific order**.
- Sets are typically used when you want
  - to check if an element is a member of a group (presence or absence) or 
  - to remove duplicates from a list.

## Map
- A map (also called a **dictionary or associative array**) is a collection of **key-value pairs**.
- Each key is associated with a value, and you can use the key to look up the corresponding value.
- Maps are useful when you want to store data that is structured in this way.

## Queue
- A queue is a collection of elements in which the elements are **added at one end and removed from the other end**. 
- This follows the "first in, first out" (FIFO) principle. 
- Queues are often used to implement processes that require tasks to be completed in a specific order.

## Stack
- A stack is a collection of elements in which elements are **added and removed from the same end**. 
- This follows the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle. 
- Stacks are often used 
  - To keep track of the order of operations in an algorithm or 
  - To implement undo/redo functionality in an application.

## Tree 
- A tree is a **hierarchical** data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. 
- Each node has a parent node (except for the root node) and zero or more child nodes. 
- Trees are often used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the **file system** on a computer or the **structure of a web page**.

In summary, the list, set, map, queue, stack and tree are all data structures used in computer science that can be classified according to their 
- order, 
- uniqueness of elements, 
- key-value association, and 
- order of processing

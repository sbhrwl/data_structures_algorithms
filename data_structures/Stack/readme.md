## Stack
- A stack is a collection of elements in which elements are **added and removed from the same end**. 
- This follows the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle. 
- Stacks are often used 
  - To keep track of the order of operations in an algorithm or 
  - To implement undo/redo functionality in an application.
